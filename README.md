## Getting started

Gatesentry Installation and Configuration Guide
1. Downloading Gatesentry:

    Navigate to the 'Releases' section of the Gatesentry website or repository.
    Identify and download the appropriate file for your operating system, named either gatesentry-linux or gatesentry-mac.

2. Installation:

For macOS and Linux:

Locate the downloaded Gatesentry binary file in your system.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded binary.
Run the following command to grant execution permissions to the binary file:

    chmod +x gatesentry-{platform}

Replace {platform} with your operating system (linux or mac).
Proceed to execute the binary file to initiate the server.

For Other Platforms:

    Follow the platform-specific procedure to ensure the binary is executable.

3. Launching the Server:

    Execute the Gatesentry binary file to start the server.
    Upon successful launch, the server will begin listening for incoming connections on port 10413.

4. Accessing the User Interface:

    Open a modern web browser of your choice.
    Enter the following URL in the address bar: http://localhost:10786
    The Gatesentry User Interface will load, providing access to various functionalities and settings.

5. Default Login Credentials:

    Username: admin
    Password: admin

Use the above credentials to log in to the Gatesentry system for the first time. For security reasons, it is highly recommended to change the default password after the initial login.
Note:

Ensure your systemâ€™s firewall and security settings allow traffic on ports 10413 and 10786 to ensure seamless operation and access to the Gatesentry server and user interface.

This guide now specifically refers to the Gatesentry software and uses the gatesentry-{platform} filename convention for clarity.
